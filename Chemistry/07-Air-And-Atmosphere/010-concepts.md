To help you memorize **Chapter 7 - Air and Atmosphere**, I'll break it down into key points, mnemonics, and easy-to-remember summaries.

## **1. AIR: What is it?**
- **Invisible, transparent, and has mass.**
- **A mixture of gases:** Nitrogen (78%), Oxygen (21%), Argon (0.9%), and others.
- **Matter:** It occupies space and has mass (proved by inflating a balloon).

### **Mnemonic to Remember Air Composition**:  
**Mnemonic:** **"No One Acts Careless Outside"**  
- **N**itrogen - 78%  
- **O**xygen - 21%  
- **A**rgon - 0.93%  
- **C**arbon dioxide - 0.03%  
- **O**thers (Neon, Helium, Krypton, Xenon, Hydrogen) - 0.04%

## **2. Composition of Air**
| Gas | Percentage |
|------|------------|
| **Nitrogen (N₂)** | 78% |
| **Oxygen (O₂)** | 21% |
| **Argon (Ar)** | 0.9% |
| **Carbon Dioxide (CO₂)** | 0.03% |
| **Other gases (Ne, He, CH₄, Kr, Xe, H₂)** | Very small amounts |

💡 **Fact**: The percentage of **CO₂ is higher in cities** due to pollution.

## **3. Properties & Uses of Gases in Air**
**1️⃣ Nitrogen (N₂)**  
✔️ Colorless, odorless, and mostly inert.  
✔️ Essential for plant growth (found in proteins, fertilizers).  
✔️ Used in **tyres, ammonia production (Haber process), explosives, and food packaging**.

**Mnemonic:** **"Five Naughty Ants Ate Dinner"**  
- **F**ixation (Nitrogen gas → Ammonia)  
- **N**itrification (Ammonia → Nitrates)  
- **A**ssimilation (Plants absorb nitrates)  
- **A**mmonification (Decomposers return nitrogen to soil)  
- **D**enitrification (Bacteria convert nitrates back to nitrogen gas)


**2️⃣ Oxygen (O₂)**  
✔️ **Essential for breathing & burning.**  
✔️ Used in **hospitals (oxygen cylinders), rocket fuel, and welding (oxy-acetylene torch).**  
✔️ Supports combustion but **does not burn itself**.

**Mnemonic:** **"Oxygen Burns Life's Water"**  
- **O**xygen  
- **B**urns (supports combustion)  
- **L**ife (essential for respiration)  
- **W**ater (dissolves in water for aquatic life)
  
**3️⃣ Carbon Dioxide (CO₂)**  
✔️ **Used in photosynthesis (plants need it to make food).**  
✔️ **Dry ice (solid CO₂) for refrigeration.**  
✔️ Found in **fire extinguishers & fizzy drinks (carbonated beverages).**  
✔️ Too much CO₂ causes the **Greenhouse Effect & Global Warming**.

**4️⃣ Water Vapor (H₂O)**
✔️ **Affects weather & climate**.  
✔️ Important for **rain, humidity, and water cycle**.

**5️⃣ Inert Gases (Neon, Argon, Helium, etc.)**  
✔️ **Helium** → Used in weather balloons.  
✔️ **Neon** → Used in neon lights (advertisement boards).  
✔️ **Argon** → Used in electric bulbs.  
✔️ **Radon** → Used in cancer treatment.

## **4. Air Pollution**
👿 **Air Pollutants:**  
✔️ **Carbon monoxide (CO)** → From cars, reduces oxygen in the blood (dangerous!).  
✔️ **Sulfur dioxide (SO₂)** → Causes acid rain.  
✔️ **Nitrogen dioxide (NO₂)** → Causes smog & respiratory problems.  
✔️ **Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)** → Destroys the ozone layer.  

**Mnemonic:** **"Cool Smog Never Pollutes Cities"**  
- **C**arbon Monoxide (CO)  
- **S**ulphur Dioxide (SO₂)  
- **N**itrogen Dioxide (NO₂)  
- **P**articulates (Smoke, Dust)  
- **C**hlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)


**Effects of Air Pollution:**  
🚫 Breathing issues, acid rain, global warming, ozone depletion.

**Ways to Reduce Air Pollution:**  
✔️ Use public transport or carpool.  
✔️ Plant more trees.  
✔️ Use cleaner fuels like **CNG and solar energy**.  
✔️ Industries should control emissions.

## **5. Important Cycles**
**🔄 The Nitrogen Cycle:**  
1️⃣ **Nitrogen Fixation** → Bacteria convert nitrogen into usable forms.  
2️⃣ **Assimilation** → Plants absorb nitrogen.  
3️⃣ **Decomposition** → Dead plants/animals release nitrogen back into the soil.  
4️⃣ **Denitrification** → Bacteria return nitrogen to the air.

**🔄 The Carbon Cycle:**  
✔️ **Photosynthesis** (plants absorb CO₂).  
✔️ **Respiration** (animals & humans release CO₂).  
✔️ **Burning fossil fuels** adds CO₂ to the air.  
✔️ **Decomposed plants & animals store carbon** underground (coal, oil, etc.).

## **6. Greenhouse Effect & Global Warming**
- 🌍 The **Greenhouse Effect** traps heat in the Earth's atmosphere.
- **Main greenhouse gases:** CO₂, CH₄ (methane), H₂O vapor.
- **Global warming effects:** Melting glaciers, climate change, sea-level rise.
- **Prevention:** Reduce fossil fuels, use renewable energy, plant trees.

**Mnemonic:** **"Cool Men Wait Near Our City"**  
- **C**arbon Dioxide (CO₂)  
- **M**ethane (CH₄)  
- **W**ater Vapour (H₂O)  
- **N**itrous Oxide (N₂O)  
- **O**zone (O₃)  
- **C**hlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)

## **7. Experiments**
🔬 **How to Show Air Has Mass?**  
- Burn a **magnesium ribbon**.  
- Compare the weight **before & after burning** (ash is heavier).  
- **Conclusion:** Air has mass because it reacts with magnesium.

🔬 **Oxygen is Necessary for Burning**  
- Place two candles. Cover one with a glass jar.  
- The covered candle **goes out**, proving oxygen is needed for burning.
