### **SECTION C**
#### **(7) Short Answer Questions**
61. **Major components of air are nitrogen (78%), oxygen (21%), carbon dioxide (0.03%), argon (0.9%), and other trace gases.**  
62. **Nitrogen is essential for plant growth and is a major component of proteins and DNA.**  
63. **Oxygen is required for respiration, which provides energy for living organisms.**  
64. **The greenhouse effect is the trapping of heat by greenhouse gases, keeping the Earth warm.**  
65. **Global warming is caused by excessive greenhouse gases leading to temperature rise.**  
66. **Air pollution can cause respiratory diseases, lung infections, and global climate change.**  
67. **Acid rain is rainwater that contains acidic pollutants such as sulfuric acid and nitric acid.**  
68. **Nitrogen is fixed by bacteria, converting it into ammonia, nitrates, and nitrites for plant use.**  
69. **Carbon monoxide binds with hemoglobin, reducing oxygen transport in the body, leading to poisoning.**  
70. **Inert gases are non-reactive gases. Examples: Argon, Neon.**  

#### **(8) Diagram-Based Questions**  
(Refer to textbook for labeled diagrams.)  
71. **Labeled diagram of nitrogen cycle**
