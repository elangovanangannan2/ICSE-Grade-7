### **SECTION C**
#### **(7) Short Answer Questions**
61. **A chemical reaction is a process in which one or more substances (reactants) undergo a chemical change to form new substances (products).**  
62. **Reactants are the substances that take part in a chemical reaction, and products are the substances formed after the reaction. Example: In the reaction 2H‚ÇÇ + O‚ÇÇ ‚Üí 2H‚ÇÇO, hydrogen and oxygen are reactants, and water is the product.**  
63. **A balanced chemical equation has the same number of atoms of each element on both sides, following the Law of Conservation of Mass.**  
64. **A chemical reaction can be identified by changes like color change, gas evolution, temperature change, or precipitate formation.**  
65. **A precipitation reaction is when two solutions react to form an insoluble solid (precipitate). Example: Pb(NO‚ÇÉ)‚ÇÇ + KI ‚Üí PbI‚ÇÇ (yellow precipitate) + KNO‚ÇÉ.**  
66. **To follow the Law of Conservation of Mass, a chemical equation must be balanced so the number of atoms remains equal on both sides.**  
67. **An exothermic reaction releases heat. Example: Neutralization of acid and base (HCl + NaOH ‚Üí NaCl + H‚ÇÇO + heat).**  
68. **Increasing temperature increases the reaction rate by providing more energy for collisions between molecules.**  
69. **Types of chemical reactions: Combination, Decomposition, Displacement, Double Displacement, and Neutralization.**  
70. **The Law of Conservation of Mass states that mass cannot be created or destroyed in a chemical reaction; it remains the same before and after the reaction.**  

#### **(8) Diagram-Based Questions**  
(Refer to textbook for labeled diagrams.)  
71. **Experimental setup to show gas evolution.**  
72. **Double displacement reaction setup.**  
73. **Decomposition reaction (e.g., decomposition of calcium carbonate).**  
74. **Color change reaction setup.**  
75. **Neutralization reaction setup.**  

#### **(9) Reasoning-Based Questions**
76. **Iron rusts when exposed to air and moisture due to oxidation, forming iron oxide (Fe‚ÇÇO‚ÇÉ¬∑xH‚ÇÇO).**  
77. **Higher temperature increases molecular movement, leading to more collisions and faster reactions.**  
78. **Milk sours due to bacterial fermentation, converting lactose into lactic acid.**  
79. **Burning a candle produces carbon dioxide, water vapor, and heat, indicating a chemical change.**  
80. **Respiration is a chemical reaction because glucose reacts with oxygen to produce carbon dioxide, water, and energy.**  

#### **(10) Chemical Formula & Symbol-Based Questions**
81. **Fe‚ÇÇO‚ÇÉ¬∑xH‚ÇÇO (Rust)**  
82. **HCl (Hydrochloric acid)**  
83. **Fe + S ‚Üí FeS (Iron + Sulfur ‚Üí Iron sulfide)**  
84. **6CO‚ÇÇ + 6H‚ÇÇO ‚Üí C‚ÇÜH‚ÇÅ‚ÇÇO‚ÇÜ + 6O‚ÇÇ (Photosynthesis)**
