## **SECTION B - Answer Key**

### **A. Short Answer Questions**
1. **Acids** are substances that release hydrogen ions (H⁺) in solution. Example: Hydrochloric Acid (HCl). **Bases** are substances that release hydroxide ions (OH⁻). Example: Sodium Hydroxide (NaOH).
2. Acids react with metals to produce hydrogen gas and salt. Example: Zn + HCl → ZnCl₂ + H₂.
3. Soap is slippery because it is a base and reacts with oils to form soap molecules.
4. Indicators like litmus paper help determine whether a substance is acidic or basic based on color changes.
5. Neutralization is the reaction between an acid and a base to form salt and water. Example: HCl + NaOH → NaCl + H₂O.

### **B. Choose the odd one out and give a reason:**
1. **Soap** (Others are acids)
2. **HCl** (Others are bases)
3. **Water** (Others are indicators)
4. **Ammonia** (Others are strong acids)

### **C. Application-based Questions:**
1. **Seema is correct** because vinegar contains acetic acid, which is a weak acid.
2. Wash immediately with lots of water and apply a mild acid like vinegar.
3. Farmers use lime (Ca(OH)₂) to reduce soil acidity and improve crop growth.
4. Baking soda neutralizes stomach acid, relieving indigestion.
5. Acid rain forms when sulfur dioxide (SO₂) and nitrogen oxides (NO₂) react with water vapor in the atmosphere, causing environmental damage.

## **SECTION C - Answer Key**

### **A. Descriptive Questions:**
1. **Classification of acids**:
   - Based on strength: Strong (HCl) vs. Weak (Acetic Acid)
   - Based on origin: Organic (Citric Acid) vs. Inorganic (Sulfuric Acid)
   - Based on number of replaceable H⁺ ions: Monoprotic (HCl), Diprotic (H₂SO₄), Triprotic (H₃PO₄)
2. **Strong acids** ionize completely (HCl, H₂SO₄), while **weak acids** ionize partially (Acetic Acid).
3. **Acid rain** forms from pollution (SO₂, NO₂), harming plants, animals, and buildings.
4. **Strong acids are stored in glass** because glass is non-reactive and does not corrode.
5. **Uses of acids and bases**:
   - Acids: Food preservation, industry, digestion
   - Bases: Cleaning agents, antacids, manufacturing
