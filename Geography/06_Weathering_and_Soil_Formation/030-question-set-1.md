### **PART II (50 Marks)**

#### **1. With reference to weathering, answer the following:**

   a) Define weathering.  
   **Answer:** Weathering is the process of breaking down rocks into smaller fragments due to physical, chemical, or biological factors **in situ** (at the same place).  

   b) Mention the three types of weathering.  
   **Answer:** The three types of weathering are **Physical Weathering, Chemical Weathering, and Biological Weathering**.  

#### **2. Differentiate between physical and chemical weathering.**

| Feature | Physical Weathering                                            | Chemical Weathering                                           |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Process | Breakdown due to physical forces like temperature, wind, water | Breakdown due to chemical reactions with air, water, or acids |
| Example | Exfoliation, frost action                                      | Oxidation, carbonation                                        |
| Region  | Common in deserts, polar areas                                 | Common in humid regions                                       |

#### **3. Explain the process of oxidation and carbonation.**

   **Answer:**  

- **Oxidation:** Oxygen reacts with minerals in rocks, particularly iron, to form iron oxide (rust), which weakens the rock and causes it to break down.  
- **Carbonation:** Carbon dioxide in the air dissolves in rainwater, forming **carbonic acid**. This weak acid reacts with limestone and dolomite, leading to the formation of caves and sinkholes.  

#### **4. Explain the factors affecting weathering.**

   **Answer:** The factors influencing weathering include:  

- **Temperature changes:** Expansion and contraction cause mechanical weathering.  
- **Water availability:** Moisture speeds up chemical weathering.  
- **Mineral composition:** Soft minerals weather faster than hard minerals.  
- **Vegetation:** Roots break rocks apart, aiding biological weathering.  
- **Human activities:** Mining, deforestation, and construction accelerate weathering.  

#### **5. Describe the layers of a soil profile.**

   **Answer:**  
   A **soil profile** has four main layers:  

- **O Horizon (Organic Layer):** Contains decomposed plant material and humus.  
- **A Horizon (Topsoil):** Rich in humus and minerals, essential for plant growth.  
- **B Horizon (Subsoil):** Contains clay and minerals leached from the topsoil.  
- **C Horizon (Weathered Rock):** Composed of broken rocks from which soil is formed.  
- **R Horizon (Bedrock):** The solid rock layer beneath all other layers.  

#### **6. What is soil erosion? Mention two types of soil erosion.**

   **Answer:** Soil erosion is the process of removal and displacement of the topsoil by wind, water, or human activities.  

   **Types of Soil Erosion:**  

- **Sheet Erosion:** The top layer of soil is washed away due to rainfall over large areas.  
- **Gully Erosion:** Deep channels or gullies are formed on slopes due to heavy water flow.  

#### **7. How can soil erosion be prevented?**

   **Answer:** Soil conservation methods include:  

- **Afforestation:** Planting trees to bind the soil.  
- **Terracing:** Constructing step-like terraces on slopes.  
- **Crop Rotation:** Growing different crops to maintain soil fertility.  
- **Contour Ploughing:** Ploughing along natural land contours to reduce runoff.
