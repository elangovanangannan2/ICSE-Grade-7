### **PART II (50 Marks)**  
(Attempt any five questions)

#### **1. Differentiate between minerals and rocks.**  

| Feature            | Minerals                         | Rocks                          |
|--------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Composition       | Definite chemical composition  | Mixture of different minerals  |
| Structure        | Usually uniform in structure   | Can be layered or crystalline  |
| Examples         | Gold, mica, gypsum            | Granite, basalt, limestone    |
| Organic Matter   | Does not contain organic matter | May contain organic remains   |

#### **2. Explain the classification of igneous rocks.**  
   **Answer:** Igneous rocks are classified into:  
   - **Intrusive (Plutonic) Rocks**: Formed **inside the Earth's crust** when magma cools slowly, forming **large crystals** (e.g., Granite, Dolerite).  
   - **Extrusive (Volcanic) Rocks**: Formed when **lava cools rapidly** on the Earth's surface, forming **small or no crystals** (e.g., Basalt, Obsidian).  
   - **Acidic Rocks**: Contain **more silica** (light-colored, less dense) (e.g., Rhyolite).  
   - **Basic Rocks**: Contain **less silica** (dark-colored, dense) (e.g., Basalt).  

---

#### **3. Describe the formation of sedimentary rocks.**  
   **Answer:** Sedimentary rocks are formed through the process of **lithification**, which includes:  
   - **Weathering**: Breaking down of pre-existing rocks into sediments.  
   - **Erosion and Transportation**: Movement of sediments by wind, water, or ice.  
   - **Deposition**: Sediments settle down in **layers** over time.  
   - **Compaction and Cementation**: The layers are pressed together by pressure, forming rocks like **sandstone, shale, and limestone**.  

---

#### **4. What is metamorphism? Explain the different types of metamorphism.**  
   **Answer:**  
   - **Metamorphism** is the process where **existing rocks** (igneous or sedimentary) undergo **changes due to heat and pressure** to form new rocks.  
   - **Types of Metamorphism:**  
     - **Contact Metamorphism**: Occurs due to **heat** from magma (e.g., Limestone â†’ Marble).  
     - **Regional Metamorphism**: Occurs due to **pressure** over large areas (e.g., Shale â†’ Slate).  
     - **Dynamic Metamorphism**: Occurs due to **earth movements and faults** (e.g., Granite â†’ Gneiss).

#### **5. Explain the significance of rocks.**  
   **Answer:** Rocks are important for:  
   - **Economic Significance:**  
     - Source of **minerals** like iron, gold, and aluminum.  
     - Provide **fossil fuels** like coal and petroleum.  
     - Used in **construction** (granite, marble).  
     - Contain **precious stones** (diamonds, rubies).  
   - **Non-Economic Significance:**  
     - Helps in **soil formation** for vegetation.  
     - Fossil-rich rocks help in **geological studies**.

#### **6. Describe the rock cycle.**  
   **Answer:**  
   The **rock cycle** is the continuous transformation of rocks into different types due to natural processes:  
   - **Igneous Rocks**: Formed from **cooling magma/lava**.  
   - **Weathering and Erosion**: Break down igneous rocks into sediments.  
   - **Sedimentary Rocks**: Formed by **compaction and lithification** of sediments.  
   - **Metamorphic Rocks**: Formed when **sedimentary or igneous rocks undergo heat and pressure**.  
   - **Melting**: Metamorphic rocks melt into magma, restarting the cycle.
