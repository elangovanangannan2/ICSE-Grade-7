### **PART II (50 Marks)**
(Attempt any five questions)

#### **1. Differentiate between topographical and non-topographical maps.**

| Feature             | Topographical Map | Non-Topographical Map |
|---------------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Purpose            | Shows elevation, landforms, and physical features | Focuses on themes like climate, population, economy |
| Representation     | Uses **contour lines**, symbols, and colours | Uses **charts, graphs, or simple outlines** |
| Scale             | **Large-scale** (detailed) | **Small-scale** (less detailed) |
| Example           | **Survey of India Maps** | **Political, climatic, or road maps** |

#### **2. Explain contour lines and their importance.**
   **Answer:**
   - **Contour lines** are imaginary lines on a topographical map that connect points of **equal elevation**.
   - They help in understanding the **shape and slope** of the land.
   - **Close contour lines** indicate a **steep slope**, while **widely spaced contour lines** indicate a **gentle slope**.
   - They help in **measuring elevation**, planning construction, and guiding navigation for hikers and geographers.

#### **3. Explain the different colours used in topographical maps.**
   **Answer:**

| Colour  | Representation |
|---------|---------------|
| **Blue** | Water bodies like lakes, rivers, and streams |
| **Green** | Vegetation, forests, and orchards |
| **Brown** | Contour lines and land elevation |
| **Red** | Roads, buildings, and railways |
| **Black** | Text, boundaries, surveyed features |
| **Yellow** | Agricultural or cultivated land |
| **White** | Barren or uncultivated land |

---

#### **4. What are the types of map scales? Explain.**
   **Answer:**

   - **Representative Fraction (RF):** Expressed as a ratio (e.g., **1:50,000**), meaning 1 cm on the map equals **50,000 cm (500 m) on the ground**.
   - **Linear or Graphical Scale:** A **visual scale** like a ruler printed on the map to measure real-world distances.
   - **Verbal Scale:** Expressed in words (e.g., **1 cm represents 5 km**).

---

#### **5. Explain the methods of measuring distance on a topographical map.**
   **Answer:**
   - **Straight-line distance:** Measured directly using a **ruler** and converted using the scale.
   - **Curved-line distance:** Used for roads, rivers, or paths. Measured using:
     - **Divider method:** Using a pair of dividers to break a curve into small straight segments.
     - **Twine method:** Placing a piece of string along the curved feature and measuring it against the scale.

---

#### **6. Explain the purpose and significance of topographical maps.**
   **Answer:**
   - **Navigation:** Used by hikers, pilots, and the military for route planning.
   - **Geographical studies:** Helps study **landforms, elevation, and terrain**.
   - **Urban and rural planning:** Used by governments for infrastructure development.
   - **Agriculture and irrigation:** Helps farmers identify land suitability for crops.
