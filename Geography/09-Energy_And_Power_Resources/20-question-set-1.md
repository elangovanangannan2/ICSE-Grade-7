### **PART II (50 Marks)**  
(Attempt any five questions)

#### **1. Differentiate between renewable and non-renewable sources of energy.**  

| Feature              | Renewable Energy Sources | Non-Renewable Energy Sources |
|----------------------|------------------------|----------------------------|
| Availability        | Unlimited, can be replenished | Limited, can be exhausted |
| Examples           | Solar, wind, hydro, geothermal | Coal, petroleum, natural gas |
| Environmental Impact | Eco-friendly, no pollution | Causes pollution, global warming |
| Dependency         | Free natural sources | Dependent on fossil fuel extraction |

#### **2. Describe the different types of coal.**  
   **Answer:** Coal is classified based on its **carbon content**:  
   - **Anthracite** (86-97% carbon): Best quality, high heat output, used in metallurgy.  
   - **Bituminous** (45-86% carbon): Used for electricity generation and steel industries.  
   - **Lignite** (25-35% carbon): Poor quality, low heating value, used for electricity production.  
   - **Peat** (Less than 25% carbon): Underdeveloped form, high moisture, produces less heat and more smoke.

#### **3. Explain how hydropower is generated.**  
   **Answer:**  
   - Hydropower is produced using the **force of falling or flowing water**.  
   - Water from a **dam or reservoir** is released through a **narrow passage**.  
   - It spins **turbines** connected to a **generator**, converting mechanical energy into electrical energy.  
   - It is a **renewable, non-polluting** source of energy.  
   - Example: **Bhakra Nangal Dam, Sardar Sarovar Dam** in India.

#### **4. List and explain different methods to conserve energy resources.**  
   **Answer:**  
   - **Avoid Wastage**: Turn off lights, fans, and devices when not in use.  
   - **Use Energy-Efficient Appliances**: Replace old bulbs with LED lights.  
   - **Promote Renewable Energy**: Use solar panels, wind power, and biofuels.  
   - **Recycle and Reuse**: Recycling reduces the need for new resource extraction.  
   - **Public Transport**: Use buses and trains to reduce fuel consumption.  

---

#### **5. Write a note on solar power.**  
   **Answer:**  
   - Solar power is obtained from the **sun’s radiation** and converted into electricity using **solar panels**.  
   - Solar panels contain **semi-conducting materials** that absorb sunlight and convert it into electricity.  
   - It is used for:  
     - **Electricity generation** (solar grids, homes)  
     - **Heating water**  
     - **Street lighting, traffic signals, and desalination**  
   - India has **abundant sunlight**, making solar energy a **sustainable option**.
