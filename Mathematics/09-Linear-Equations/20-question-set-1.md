**4. Graphical Representation:**  
Plot the solution of **$2x - 5 = 3$** on a number line.

----------

## **SECTION B (4 x 10 = 40 marks)**

(Answer any four questions)

**5. Solve for x:**  
a) **$4x - 3 = 2x + 5$**  
b) **$(x + 2)/3 = 4$**  
c) **$7x - 4 = 3x + 8$**

**6. Solve and check your answer:**  
a) **$(3x - 1)/2 = (2x + 5)/3$**  
b) **$5(x - 2) = 2(x + 6)$**

**8. Solve the inequality and represent the solution on a number line:**  
a) **$3x - 4 < 8$**  
b) **$5 - 2x \geq 1$**

**9. Higher-Order Thinking Question:**  
A purse contains ₹500 and ₹200 notes. The total number of notes is 10, and their total value is ₹3200. Find the number of each type of note.

**10. Application-Based Problem:**  
A school orders a total of 100 books consisting of English and Mathematics books. The cost of an English book is ₹250, and the cost of a Mathematics book is ₹300. If the total cost of the books is ₹27,000, find how many books of each subject were ordered.
