## **SECTION A (4 x 10 = 40 marks)**
(Answer all questions)

### **1. Choose the correct option:**  

a) The solution of the equation **2x - 3 = 7** is:
   - (a) 5  
   - (b) -5  
   - (c) 3  
   - (d) 7  
   
   **Solution:**
   \[ 2x - 3 = 7 \]
   Add 3 to both sides:
   \[ 2x = 10 \]
   Divide by 2:
   \[ x = 5 \]
   **Answer: (a) 5**

b) If **5y - 2 = 3(y + 2)**, then y = ?
   - (a) 4
   - (b) 3
   - (c) 2
   - (d) 1

   **Solution:**
   \[ 5y - 2 = 3(y + 2) \]
   Expand:
   \[ 5y - 2 = 3y + 6 \]
   Subtract 3y from both sides:
   \[ 2y - 2 = 6 \]
   Add 2 to both sides:
   \[ 2y = 8 \]
   Divide by 2:
   \[ y = 4 \]
   **Answer: (a) 4**

c) Which of the following is NOT a linear equation in one variable?
   - (a) 2x + 5 = 0
   - (b) 3x - 7 = 10
   - (c) x^2 + 3x - 5 = 0
   - (d) 5 - x = 8

   **Solution:**
   A linear equation has the highest power of the variable as **1**.
   - Options (a), (b), and (d) have power 1.
   - Option (c) has **xÂ²**, which makes it a quadratic equation, not linear.
   **Answer: (c) xÂ² + 3x - 5 = 0**

### **2. Solve the following equations:**

a) **3(x - 4) = 2(x + 1)**  
   **Solution:**
   Expand:
   \[ 3x - 12 = 2x + 2 \]
   Subtract 2x from both sides:
   \[ x - 12 = 2 \]
   Add 12 to both sides:
   \[ x = 14 \]
   **Answer: x = 14**

b) **5x + 3 = 2x + 18**
   **Solution:**
   Subtract 2x from both sides:
   \[ 5x - 2x + 3 = 18 \]
   \[ 3x + 3 = 18 \]
   Subtract 3 from both sides:
   \[ 3x = 15 \]
   Divide by 3:
   \[ x = 5 \]
   **Answer: x = 5**

### **3. Word Problems:**  

a) The sum of two consecutive even numbers is 42. Find the numbers.  
   **Solution:**
   Let the first even number be **x**.
   The next even number is **x + 2**.
   \[ x + (x + 2) = 42 \]
   \[ 2x + 2 = 42 \]
   Subtract 2:
   \[ 2x = 40 \]
   Divide by 2:
   \[ x = 20 \]
   The numbers are **20 and 22**.
   **Answer: 20, 22**

b) The length of a rectangle is 3 units more than its breadth, and its perimeter is 32 units. Find its length and breadth.
   **Solution:**
   Let the breadth be **x**.
   Then, the length is **x + 3**.
   Perimeter formula:
   \[ 2 \times (length + breadth) = 32 \]
   \[ 2(x + x + 3) = 32 \]
   \[ 2(2x + 3) = 32 \]
   \[ 4x + 6 = 32 \]
   Subtract 6:
   \[ 4x = 26 \]
   Divide by 4:
   \[ x = 6.5 \]
   Breadth = **6.5 units**, Length = **9.5 units**.
   **Answer: Breadth = 6.5, Length = 9.5**

### **4. Graphical Representation:**  
Plot the solution of **2x - 5 = 3** on a number line.
   **Solution:**
   \[ 2x - 5 = 3 \]
   Add 5:
   \[ 2x = 8 \]
   Divide by 2:
   \[ x = 4 \]
   **Answer: x = 4** (Plot 4 on the number line).
