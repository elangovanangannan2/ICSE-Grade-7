   - $y = 4$
   - **Correct Answer:** (a) 4

c) **Identifying Non-Linear Equation**
   - The equation $x^2 + 3x - 5 = 0$ is quadratic, not linear.
   - **Correct Answer:** (c) $x^2 + 3x - 5 = 0$

---

### **2. Solve the following equations:**

a) **Solving $3(x - 4) = 2(x + 1)$**
   - $3x - 12 = 2x + 2$
   - $3x - 2x = 2 + 12$
   - $x = 14$

b) **Solving $5x + 3 = 2x + 18$**
   - $5x - 2x = 18 - 3$
   - $3x = 15$
   - $x = 5$

---

### **3. Word Problems:**

a) **Finding Two Consecutive Even Numbers**
   - Let the numbers be x and x+2
   - $x + (x+2) = 42$
   - $2x + 2 = 42$
   - $2x = 40$
   - x = 20, so numbers are **20 and 22**

b) **Finding Length and Breadth of Rectangle**
   - Let breadth = x, then length = x + 3
   - Perimeter formula: $2(l + b) = 32$
   - $2(x + x+3) = 32$
   - $2(2x+3) = 32$
   - $4x + 6 = 32$
   - $4x = 26$
   - $x = 6.5$
   - **Breadth = 6.5, Length = 9.5**

### **4. Graphical Representation:**

a) **Plotting $2x - 5 = 3$ on a number line**
   - $2x = 8$
   - $x = 4$
   - Mark **4** on the number line.

## **SECTION B (4 × 10 = 40 marks)**

### **5. Solve for x:**

a) **Solving $4x - 3 = 2x + 5$**
   - $4x - 2x = 5 + 3$
   - $2x = 8$
   - $x = 4$

b) **Solving $\frac{x+2}{3} = 4$**
   - $x + 2 = 12$
   - $x = 10$

c) **Solving $7x - 4 = 3x + 8$**
   - $7x - 3x = 8 + 4$
   - $4x = 12$
   - $x = 3$

---

### **6. Solve and Check:**

a) **Solving $\frac{3x-1}{2} = \frac{2x+5}{3}$**
   - Cross multiply: $3(3x-1) = 2(2x+5)$
   - $9x - 3 = 4x + 10$
   - $9x - 4x = 10 + 3$
   - $5x = 13$
   - $x = \frac{13}{5}$

b) **Solving $5(x - 2) = 2(x + 6)$**
   - $5x - 10 = 2x + 12$
   - $5x - 2x = 12 + 10$
   - $3x = 22$
   - $x = \frac{22}{3}$

---

### **7. Word Problems:**

a) **Father's and Son's Age**
   - Let son's age be x, then father’s age = $3x$
   - After 10 years: $3x + 10 = 2(x + 10)$
   - $3x + 10 = 2x + 20$
   - $3x - 2x = 10$
   - x = 10, so son = **10 years**, father = **30 years**

b) **Sum of Two Numbers = 72**
   - Let one number be x, other = 2x
   - $x + 2x = 72$
   - $3x = 72$
   - $x = 24$, so numbers are **24 and 48**

---

### **8. Solve the inequality and represent on number line:**

a) **Solving $3x - 4 < 8$**
   - $3x < 12$
   - $x < 4$
   - Mark **all values less than 4** on a number line.

b) **Solving $5 - 2x \geq 1$**
   - $-2x \geq -4$
   - $x \leq 2$ (reversing inequality when dividing by negative)
   - Mark **all values less than or equal to 2** on a number line.

### **9. Higher-Order Thinking Question:**
- **Solving Notes Problem:**
   - Let ₹500 notes = x, ₹200 notes = 10 - x
   - Equation: 500x + 200(10 - x) = 3200
   - 500x + 2000 - 200x = 3200
   - 300x = 1200
   - x = 4
   - ₹500 notes = **4**, ₹200 notes = **6**

---

### **10. Application-Based Problem:**
- **Books Ordered by School**
   - Let English books = x, Mathematics books = $100 - x$
   - $250x + 300(100 - x) = 27000$
   - $250x + 30000 - 300x = 27000$
   - $-50x = -3000$
   - x = 60, so English books = **60**, Mathematics books = **40**
