## **SECTION A (4 × 10 = 40 marks)**

### **1. Choose the correct option:**
   
a) If two angles are complementary, their sum is:
   - **Correct Answer:** (ii) 90°
   - **Explanation:** Complementary angles sum up to 90°.

b) If two lines are parallel, then their corresponding angles are:
   - **Correct Answer:** (i) Equal
   - **Explanation:** When a transversal cuts two parallel lines, corresponding angles are always equal.

c) An angle that measures more than 90° but less than 180° is called:
   - **Correct Answer:** (ii) Obtuse Angle
   - **Explanation:** An obtuse angle is greater than 90° but less than 180°.

 d) If one angle of a linear pair is 65°, the other angle will be:
   - **Correct Answer:** (i) 115°
   - **Explanation:** Linear pairs are supplementary, meaning their sum is 180°.
     - Other angle = 180° - 65° = 115°

---

### **2. Solve the following:**

a) Find the supplement of 117°.
   - **Solution:** Supplementary angles sum up to 180°.
     - Supplement of 117° = 180° - 117° = **63°**

b) Find the complement of 53°.
   - **Solution:** Complementary angles sum up to 90°.
     - Complement of 53° = 90° - 53° = **37°**

c) Two complementary angles are in the ratio 2:3. Find both angles.
   - **Solution:** Let the angles be **2x** and **3x**.
     - 2x + 3x = 90°
     - 5x = 90°
     - x = 18°
     - Angles: **2x = 36°, 3x = 54°**

---

### **3. Find the value of x:**

a) If two vertically opposite angles are given as (4x + 10)° and (2x + 50)°, find x.
   - **Solution:**
     - 4x + 10 = 2x + 50 (Vertically opposite angles are equal)
     - 4x - 2x = 50 - 10
     - 2x = 40
     - x = **20**

b) Two supplementary angles are in the ratio 7:2. Find both angles.
   - **Solution:** Let the angles be **7x** and **2x**.
     - 7x + 2x = 180°
     - 9x = 180°
     - x = 20°
     - Angles: **7x = 140°, 2x = 40°**

### **4. State TRUE or FALSE:**

a) Two obtuse angles can be supplementary. **FALSE** (Their sum would exceed 180°)

b) Adjacent angles always form a linear pair. **FALSE** (Only if their sum is 180°)

c) If two angles form a linear pair, they are always supplementary. **TRUE**

d) Two right angles can be complementary. **FALSE** (Their sum is 180°, not 90°)

### **5. Solve the following problems:**

a) A transversal intersects two parallel lines. One of the angles formed is 75°. Find corresponding, alternate, and co-interior angles.
   - **Solution:**
     - Corresponding angle = 75°
     - Alternate interior angle = 75°
     - Co-interior angle = 180° - 75° = **105°**

b) Given **∠AOB = 40°** and **∠BOC = 2x + 20°**, find x if **AOB and BOC form a linear pair**.
   - **Solution:**
     - ∠AOB + ∠BOC = 180°
     - 40 + (2x + 20) = 180
     - 2x + 60 = 180
     - 2x = 120
     - x = **60**

## **SECTION B (4 × 10 = 40 marks)**

### **6. Graph-Based Question:**

a) **Bar Graph Representation** (Graph drawn separately)

b) **Students who scored more than 30 marks:**
   - 40 marks: 8 students
   - 50 marks: 12 students
   - **Total: 8 + 12 = 20 students**

---

### **7. Solving for Angles:**

a) If one alternate interior angle is 65°, other angles:
   - Alternate interior: **65°**
   - Corresponding: **65°**
   - Co-interior: **115°**

b) Two angles in ratio 5:4 forming a linear pair:
   - 5x + 4x = 180°
   - 9x = 180°
   - x = 20°
   - Angles: **100°, 80°**

---

### **8. Solving Equations:**

a) **5(x - 2) + 3 = 4x + 7**
   - 5x - 10 + 3 = 4x + 7
   - 5x - 7 = 4x + 7
   - x = 14

b) **Angles of a quadrilateral (3:4:5:6)**
   - 3x + 4x + 5x + 6x = 360°
   - 18x = 360°
   - x = 20°
   - Angles: **60°, 80°, 100°, 120°**

---

### **9. Application-Based Question:**

a) **Ladder Angle**: 180° - 65° = **115°**

b) **Car Travel:** Distance = Speed × Time
   - 60 km/h × (20/60) h = **20 km**

---

### **10. HOTS:**

a) **Three consecutive angles on a straight line**
   - x + (x + 10) + (x + 20) = 180°
   - 3x + 30 = 180
   - x = 50

b) **Vertically opposite angles**
   - 5x + 10 = 3x + 50
   - 2x = 40
   - x = 20
   - Angles: **110°**
