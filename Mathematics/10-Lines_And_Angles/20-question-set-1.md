   - (i) Equal  
   - (ii) Supplementary  
   - (iii) Complementary  
   - (iv) None of these  
   
   c) An angle that measures more than **90° but less than 180°** is called:  
   
   - (i) Right Angle  
   - (ii) Obtuse Angle  
   - (iii) Acute Angle

   b) Adjacent angles always form a linear pair.  
   c) If two angles form a linear pair, they are always supplementary.  
   d) Two right angles can be complementary.  

5. **Solve the following problems:**  
   a) A transversal intersects two parallel lines. One of the angles formed is **75°**. Find the corresponding, alternate, and co-interior angles.  
   b) In the given figure, **∠AOB = 40°** and **∠BOC = 2x + 20°**. Find the value of x if **AOB and BOC form a linear pair**.

## **SECTION B (4 × 10 = 40 marks)**

(Answer any four questions)

6. **Graph-Based Question:**  
   The table below shows the number of students who scored different marks in a test:
   
   | Marks    | 10  | 20  | 30  | 40  | 50  |
   | -------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
   | Students | 4   | 6   | 10  | 8   | 12  |
   
   a) Represent this data using a **bar graph**.  
   b) How many students scored more than 30 marks?  

7. **Solving for Angles:**  
   a) In the given figure, **two parallel lines are cut by a transversal**. If one alternate interior angle is **65°**, find all the other angles formed.  
   b) Two angles are in the ratio **5:4**, and they form a linear pair. Find the angles.  

8. **Solving Equations:**  
   a) Find the value of x: **5(x - 2) + 3 = 4x + 7**.  
   b) The angles of a quadrilateral are in the ratio **3:4:5:6**. Find each angle.  

9. **Application-Based Question:**  
   a) A ladder leans against a wall and makes an angle of **65°** with the ground. Find the angle made with the wall.  
   b) A car is traveling at **60 km/h**. How much distance will it cover in **20 minutes**?  

10. **Higher Order Thinking Skills (HOTS):**  
    a) The sum of three consecutive angles on a straight line is **180°**. If one angle is **x**, the second is **(x + 10)°**, and the third is **(x + 20)°**, find the value of x.  
    b) In the figure, **∠ABC = 5x + 10°** and **∠DEF = 3x + 50°**. If they are vertically opposite angles, find the value of x and both angles.
