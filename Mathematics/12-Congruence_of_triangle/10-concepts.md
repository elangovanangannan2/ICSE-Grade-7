### **Summary of Chapter: Congruence of Triangles**

#### **Introduction**
- **Congruence** means two objects have the same shape and size.
- Examples: Two identical photographs, two â‚¹5 coins, or two toy models made from the same mold.

#### **Congruence in Geometry**
1. **Congruence of Line Segments**  
   - Two line segments are congruent if they have the same length.

2. **Congruence of Angles**  
   - Two angles are congruent if they have the same measurement.

3. **Congruence of Circles**  
   - Two circles are congruent if they have the same radius.

4. **Congruence of Squares and Rectangles**  
   - Two squares are congruent if their sides are equal.
   - Two rectangles are congruent if their lengths and breadths are equal.

#### **Congruence of Triangles**
- **Definition**: Two triangles are congruent if their corresponding sides and angles are equal.
- **Notation**: If â–³ABC â‰… â–³PQR, then:
  - **Sides**: AB = PQ, BC = QR, CA = RP
  - **Angles**: âˆ A = âˆ P, âˆ B = âˆ Q, âˆ C = âˆ R
- **CPCT (Corresponding Parts of Congruent Triangles)**: When two triangles are congruent, all their corresponding parts are equal.

#### **Criteria for Congruence of Triangles**
To prove two triangles are congruent, we don't need to compare all six elements (three sides and three angles). The following conditions are sufficient:

1. **SSS (Side-Side-Side) Criterion**  
   - If three sides of one triangle are equal to three sides of another, the triangles are congruent.

2. **SAS (Side-Angle-Side) Criterion**  
   - If two sides and the included angle of one triangle are equal to two sides and the included angle of another, the triangles are congruent.

3. **ASA (Angle-Side-Angle) Criterion**  
   - If two angles and the included side of one triangle are equal to two angles and the included side of another, the triangles are congruent.

4. **AAS (Angle-Angle-Side) Criterion**  
   - If two angles and a non-included side of one triangle are equal to the corresponding angles and side of another, the triangles are congruent.

5. **RHS (Right Angle-Hypotenuse-Side) Criterion**  
   - If the hypotenuse and one side of a right-angled triangle are equal to the hypotenuse and one side of another right-angled triangle, they are congruent.

#### **Key Points**
- Congruent triangles are identical in shape and size.
- The order of corresponding vertices matters in congruence.
- AAA (Angle-Angle-Angle) **does not** guarantee congruence, as triangles may have the same angles but different sizes.
- CPCT can be used to prove additional properties once two triangles are proved congruent.
