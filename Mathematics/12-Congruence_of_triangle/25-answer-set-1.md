### **2. Solve the following:**

a) **Definition of Congruence and Examples**

- **Congruence** means two triangles have the same shape and size.
- **Real-life examples:**
  - Two identical traffic signboards.
  - Two blades of a pair of scissors.

b) **Checking Congruence:**

- Given sides: 5 cm, 6 cm, 7 cm and 5 cm, 6 cm, 7 cm
- Since all three sides are equal, the triangles are congruent by **SSS criterion**.

c) **Finding the Missing Angle:**

- Sum of angles in a triangle = 180°
- Missing angle = 180° - (65° + 45°) = **70°**

---

### **3. Solve the following equations:**

a) **Proof of Congruence using SSS Rule**

- Given:  AB = DE = 5  cm,  BC = EF = 7  cm,  CA = FD = 6  cm
- Since all three sides are equal,  $\triangle ABC \cong \triangle DEF$ by **SSS**.

b) **Finding missing values in congruent triangles:**

- Since  $\triangle XYZ \cong \triangle PQR$, corresponding sides are equal.
- XY = PQ = 8  cm,  YZ = QR = 10  cm,  XZ = PR = 6  cm.

c) **Finding the Third Angle:**

- Sum of angles in a triangle = 180°
- Third angle = 180° - (50° + 60°) = **70°**

---

### **4. TRUE or FALSE:**

a) **True** (Congruent triangles have equal perimeters.)

b) **False** (Two triangles can have the same area but different shapes.)

c) **True** (By RHS theorem, right-angled triangles with equal hypotenuses and one leg are congruent.)

d) **False** (**AAA** does not ensure congruence, only similarity.)

---

### **5. Solve the following problems:**

a) **Proof of RHS Congruence:**

- Given: Right triangles with equal hypotenuses and one equal leg.
- By **RHS rule**, the two triangles are congruent.

b) **Proof of Congruence using SSS Criterion:**

- Given:  AB = XY = 5  cm,  AC = XZ = 7  cm,  BC = YZ = 6  cm
- Since all three sides are equal, **ΔABC ≅ ΔXYZ** by **SSS rule**.

c) **Finding Triangle Sides and Proving Right-Angled Triangle:**

- Ratio: 3:4:5, Perimeter = 36 cm.
- Side lengths: $3x + 4x + 5x = 36 ⟶ x = 3$ ⟶ Sides: **9 cm, 12 cm, 15 cm**.
- Applying **Pythagoras theorem:**  $9^2 + 12^2 = 15^2$  ⟶ **Right-angled triangle.**

- If two roads form equal angles and have a common side, then the triangles are **congruent by ASA**.

---

### **7. Properties of Congruent Triangles:**

a) **Proving RHS Rule:**

- If two right triangles have equal hypotenuses and one equal leg, their third sides must be equal by **Pythagoras theorem**.

b) **Isosceles Triangle Congruence:**

- An isosceles triangle has two equal sides and equal angles.
- If two isosceles triangles have equal bases, they are **congruent by SSS or ASA**.

c) **Superimposing Congruent Triangles:**

- If two congruent triangles are placed on each other with aligned sides, their angles remain **unchanged**.
