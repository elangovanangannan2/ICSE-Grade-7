      - (ii) Corresponding sides are equal  
      - (iii) Both corresponding sides and angles are equal  
      - (iv) None of the above  

   b) The congruence rule **SAS** states that two triangles are congruent if:  
      - (i) Two sides and the non-included angle are equal  
      - (ii) Two sides and the included angle are equal  
      - (iii) All three sides are equal  
      - (iv) All three angles are equal

c) If two right triangles have equal hypotenuses and one pair of equal legs, then they are congruent.  
d) The **AAA** (Angle-Angle-Angle) rule is a valid congruence criterion for triangles.
