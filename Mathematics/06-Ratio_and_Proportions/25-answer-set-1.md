### **2. Solve the following:**

a) Ratio of 150 cm to 2 meters:

- 2 meters = 200 cm
- Ratio =  $\frac{150}{200} = 3:4$

b) Convert to ratios:

- 25 min to 45 sec:
  - 25 min = 1500 sec
  - Ratio =  $\frac{1500}{45} = 100:3$
- 3 kg to 500 g:
  - 3 kg = 3000 g
  - Ratio =  $\frac{3000}{500} = 6:1$

c) Find x in proportion:

- $\frac{9}{x} = \frac{3}{5}$ 
- Cross multiply:  $9 \times 5 = 3x$
- x = 15

### **3. Solve the following equations:**

a) Number of girls in school:

- Ratio of boys to girls = 5:6
- Total parts = 5+6 = 11
- Number of girls =  $\frac{6}{11} \times 210 = 114$

b) Fourth proportional:

- $\frac{7}{21} = \frac{9}{x}$
- Cross multiply:  $7x = 21 \times 9$
- x = 27 

c) Worker’s savings and expenses:

- Savings = Earnings - Expenses = 1200 - 900 = 300
- Savings to earnings =  300:1200 = 1:4 
- Expenses to earnings =  900:1200 = 3:4

### **5. Solve the following problems:**

a) Share of ₹5,400 among three children in 4:5:7:

- Total parts = 4+5+7 = 16
- Share of each:
  - $\frac{4}{16} \times 5400 = ₹1350$ 
  - $\frac{5}{16} \times 5400 = ₹1687.50$
  - $\frac{7}{16} \times 5400 = ₹2362.50$

b) Number of balls:

- Total balls = 54, ratio = 3:2:4
- Total parts = 3+2+4 = 9
- Number of each:
  - Red:  $\frac{3}{9} \times 54 = 18$
  - Blue:  $\frac{2}{9} \times 54 = 12$ 
  - Green:  $\frac{4}{9} \times 54 = 24$ 

c) Cost of 7 pens:

- Cost per pen =  $\frac{360}{12} = 30$
- Cost of 7 pens = 7 × 30 = **₹210**

  - $\frac{3}{10} \times 780 = ₹234$
  - $\frac{5}{10} \times 780 = ₹390$

b) Distance walked in 5 hours:

- Distance per hour = 7 ÷ 2 = 3.5 km
- Distance in 5 hours = **17.5 km**

c) Weight of heavier object:

- $\frac{4}{3} \times 18 = 24 kg$
