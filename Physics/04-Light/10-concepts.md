### **Summary of the Lesson: Light**

#### **Introduction**

Light is a form of energy that allows us to see objects. When light strikes a surface, it can be reflected, absorbed, or transmitted. Reflection is the process by which light bounces back from a surface.

### **Key Concepts Covered in the Lesson**

#### **1. Reflection of Light**

- Reflection occurs when light bounces off a smooth or polished surface.
- A **mirror** is a perfect reflector as it does not absorb or allow light to pass through.
- The image seen in a mirror is a result of **regular reflection**.

#### **2. Terms Related to Reflection**

- **Incident Ray**: The light ray that falls on a surface.
- **Point of Incidence**: The point where the incident ray strikes the surface.
- **Normal**: A perpendicular line drawn at the point of incidence.
- **Reflected Ray**: The light ray that bounces back after striking the surface.
- **Angle of Incidence (i)**: The angle between the incident ray and the normal.
- **Angle of Reflection (r)**: The angle between the reflected ray and the normal.

#### **3. Laws of Reflection**

1. **First Law:** The incident ray, the reflected ray, and the normal all lie in the same plane.
2. **Second Law:** The angle of incidence is always equal to the angle of reflection (i = r).

#### **4. Types of Reflection**

- **Regular Reflection**: Occurs on a smooth surface like a mirror, where reflected rays remain parallel, producing a clear image.
- **Irregular (Diffused) Reflection**: Occurs on rough surfaces like walls or stones, where reflected rays scatter in different directions, producing no clear image.

#### **5. Image Formation by a Plane Mirror**

- The image formed is:
  - **Virtual** (not real, cannot be captured on a screen).
  - **Upright** (erect).
  - **Same size** as the object.
  - **Laterally inverted** (left and right are reversed).
  - **At the same distance** behind the mirror as the object in front.

#### **6. Real and Virtual Images**

- **Real Image**: Formed when light rays actually meet; it is inverted and can be captured on a screen.
- **Virtual Image**: Formed when light rays only appear to meet; it is upright and cannot be captured on a screen.

#### **7. Applications of Mirrors**

- **Plane mirrors** are used in:
  - Dressing tables and periscopes.
  - Showcases and decorations.
  - Vehicles (rear-view mirrors).
  - Solar cookers for directing sunlight.

#### **8. Speed of Light**

- Light travels at different speeds in different media:
  - **Air/Vacuum**: \( 3.0 \times 10^8 \) m/s
  - **Water**: \( 2.25 \times 10^8 \) m/s
  - **Glass**: \( 2.0 \times 10^8 \) m/s

#### **9. Colours of Light**

- **Primary Colours**: Red, Green, and Blue (RGB).
- **Secondary Colours**: Formed by mixing two primary colours:
  - Red + Blue = Magenta
  - Blue + Green = Cyan
  - Red + Green = Yellow
- **Complementary Colours**: Two colours that combine to form white light.
  - Example: Red + Cyan = White.

#### **10. Appearance of Colours**

- Objects appear coloured based on which wavelengths of light they reflect or absorb.
- Example:
  - A **red** object absorbs all colours except red, which it reflects.
  - A **white** object reflects all colours.
  - A **black** object absorbs all colours and reflects none.

#### **11. Lateral Inversion**

- When we look into a mirror, the left and right sides appear reversed.
- This is why the word **"AMBULANCE"** is written in reverse on emergency vehicles, so it appears correctly in the rear-view mirror of other vehicles.

#### **12. Multiple Reflections**

- **Periscopes and Kaleidoscopes** use multiple reflections to form images.

---

### **Conclusion**

- Light follows the laws of reflection.
- Mirrors form virtual, upright, and laterally inverted images.
- The colour of an object depends on the light it reflects.
- Understanding reflection and colours helps in various real-world applications, including optical instruments and daily life objects.
