### **Formulas from the Lesson on Light**

---

### **1. Law of Reflection**

#### **Formula:**

$\theta_i = \theta_r$

**Where:**  

- $\theta_i$ = Angle of incidence  
- $\theta_r$ = Angle of reflection  

**Example:**  
A light ray strikes a mirror at an angle of 30¬∞. What will be the angle of reflection?  
**Solution:**  
Using the law of reflection:  

$\theta_r = \theta_i = 30^\circ$

So, the angle of reflection is **30¬∞**.

### **2. Distance of Image in a Plane Mirror**

#### **Formula:**

$d_o = d_i$

**Where:**  

- $d_o$  = Distance of the object from the mirror  
- $d_i$  = Distance of the image behind the mirror  

**Example:**  
If a person stands **2 meters** in front of a plane mirror, where is the image located?  
**Solution:**  

$d_i = d_o = 2 \text{ meters}$

So, the image is formed **2 meters behind** the mirror.

---

### **3. Speed of Light**

#### **Formula:**

$c = 3.0 \times 10^8 \text{ m/s}$

**Where:**  

- c  = Speed of light in vacuum or air  

**Speed of light in different media:**

- **Vacuum/Air:**  $3.0 \times 10^8 m/s$
- **Water:**  $2.25 \times 10^8 m/s$
- **Glass:**  $2.0 \times 10^8 m/s$

**Example:**  
If light takes **2 √ó 10‚Åª‚Åπ seconds** to travel through a 60 cm glass slab, what is the speed of light in the glass?  
**Solution:**  

$\text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{0.60}{2 \times 10^{-9}} = 3.0 \times 10^8 \text{ m/s}$

So, the speed of light in glass is ** $3.0 \times 10^8 m/s$**.

---

### **4. Refractive Index**

#### **Formula:**

$n = \frac{c}{v}$

**Where:**  

- n  = Refractive index  
- c  = Speed of light in vacuum  
- v  = Speed of light in the medium  

**Example:**  
The speed of light in water is ** $2.25 \times 10^8 m/s$**. What is the refractive index of water?  
**Solution:**  

$n = \frac{3.0 \times 10^8}{2.25 \times 10^8} = 1.33$

So, the refractive index of water is **1.33**.

---

### **5. Relation Between Wavelength, Frequency, and Speed of Light**

#### **Formula:**

$c = \lambda f$

**Where:**  

- c  = Speed of light  
- $\lambda$  = Wavelength of light (in meters)  
- f  = Frequency of light (in Hertz)  

**Example:**  
If the frequency of red light is ** $4.3 \times 10^{14}$ Hz**, what is its wavelength?  
**Solution:**  

$\lambda = \frac{c}{f} = \frac{3.0 \times 10^8}{4.3 \times 10^{14}}$

$= 7.0 \times 10^{-7} \text{ m} = 700 \text{ nm}$

So, the wavelength of red light is **700 nm**.

---

### **6. Lateral Inversion (Image Reversal)**

#### **Formula:**

M = -1

**Where:**  

- M  = Magnification (negative sign indicates inversion)  

**Example:**  
The word **"AMBULANCE"** is written in reverse on the front of an ambulance so that it appears correctly in a rear-view mirror.

---

### **7. Colour Subtraction**

#### **Formula:**

$\text{White light} - \text{absorbed colour} = \text{reflected colour}$

**Example:**  
If a cloth absorbs **red** and reflects **blue and green**, what colour does it appear?  
**Solution:**  

$\text{White} - \text{Red} = \text{Cyan} (\text{Blue} + \text{Green})$

So, the cloth appears **cyan**.

---

### **8. Image Distance in a Plane Mirror**

#### **Formula:**

$h_i = h_o$

**Where:**  

- $h_i$  = Height of the image  
- $h_o$  = Height of the object  

**Example:**  
If a person is **1.6 meters** tall, what is the height of their image in a plane mirror?  
**Solution:**  

$h_i = h_o = 1.6 \text{ m}$

So, the image height is **1.6 meters**.

---

### **9. Multiple Reflections**

#### **Formula for Number of Images Formed by Two Mirrors at an Angle  \theta :**

$N = \frac{360^\circ}{\theta} - 1$

**Example:**  
Two mirrors are placed at an angle of **90¬∞**. How many images will be formed?  
**Solution:**  

$N = \frac{360^\circ}{90^\circ} - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3$

So, **3 images** will be formed.

---

### **10. Magnification Formula**

#### **Formula:**

$M = \frac{\text{Height of image} (h_i)}{\text{Height of object} (h_o)}$

$M = \frac{\text{Image Distance} (d_i)}{\text{Object Distance} (d_o)}$

**Example:**  
If an object **10 cm** tall is placed **20 cm** in front of a plane mirror, what is the size of its image?  
**Solution:**  

$M = \frac{h_i}{h_o} = 1 \Rightarrow h_i = 10 \text{ cm}$

So, the image height is **10 cm**.
