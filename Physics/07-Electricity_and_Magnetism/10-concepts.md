# **Electricity and Magnetism - Summary with Formulas and Examples**

## **Laws of Magnetism**
- Like poles repel each other, and unlike poles attract.
- **Example:** Two bar magnets â€“ bringing North-North poles close repels them, while North-South attracts.

## **Magnetic Field**
- **Magnetic Field (B)** is the region around a magnet where its influence can be felt.
- **Magnetic field due to a straight current-carrying wire**:
  - **Formula:**  $B = \frac{\mu_0 I}{2 \pi r}$ 
  - **Example:** A long wire carrying current produces concentric circular magnetic fields around it.

- **Magnetic field due to a circular loop**:
  - **Formula at the center:**  $B = \frac{\mu_0 I}{2R}$ 
  - **Example:** A loop of wire carrying current produces a magnetic field at its center.

## **Electromagnetism**
- Electric current produces a magnetic field around a conductor.
- **Example:** Hans Oersted's experiment â€“ a compass needle deflects when placed near a current-carrying wire.

## **Electromagnetic Induction**
- **Faradayâ€™s Law:** A changing magnetic field induces an electromotive force (emf) in a circuit.
  - **Formula:**  $\mathcal{E} = - N \frac{d\Phi}{dt}$ 
  - **Example:** Moving a bar magnet in and out of a coil generates current.

## **Electromagnets**
- A **temporary magnet** created by passing current through a coil wrapped around an iron core.
- **Example:** An iron nail wrapped with copper wire connected to a battery acts as a magnet.

## **Solenoid**
- A tightly wound coil that behaves like a bar magnet when current flows through it.
- **Example:** MRI machines use solenoids to generate strong magnetic fields.

## **Electricity and Circuits**
- **Electric Current (I):** Flow of electric charge.
  - **Formula:**  I = $\frac{Q}{t}$  (Charge per unit time)
  - **Example:** In a wire, electrons flow to create current.

- **Potential Difference (V):** Work done to move charge between two points.
  - **Formula:**  V = IR  (Ohmâ€™s Law)
  - **Example:** A 12V battery supplies voltage to a circuit.

## **Electric Circuits**
- **Series Circuit:**
  - Same current flows through all components.
  - **Total resistance:**  $R_{total} = R_1 + R_2 + R_3$ 
  - **Example:** Bulbs in a series â€“ if one fails, all stop working.

- **Parallel Circuit:**
  - Voltage is the same across components.
  - **Total resistance:**  $\frac{1}{R_{total}} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2}$ 
  - **Example:** House wiring â€“ appliances work independently.

## **Electric Bell**
- Uses an electromagnet to repeatedly strike a gong when current flows.
- **Example:** Doorbells in homes.

## **Types of Current**
1. **Direct Current (DC):** Flows in one direction.
   - **Example:** Batteries and cells.
2. **Alternating Current (AC):** Changes direction periodically.
   - **Example:** Home electricity supply (220V, 50Hz in India).

## **Sources of Electricity**
1. **Primary Cells (Non-rechargeable):** Dry cells, button cells.
2. **Secondary Cells (Rechargeable):** Car batteries, mobile phone batteries.
