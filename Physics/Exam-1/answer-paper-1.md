#### **Q6. Give reasons for the following:** [5]  
1. **Why does a black surface absorb more heat than a white surface?**  
   **Answer: A black surface absorbs all wavelengths of light, converting them into heat, while white reflects most of the light.**  
2. **Why does a plane mirror always form a virtual image?**  
   **Answer: A plane mirror always forms a virtual image because the reflected rays appear to diverge from behind the mirror but do not actually meet.**  
3. **Why is it difficult to walk on ice compared to a rough surface?**  
   **Answer: Ice has a lower coefficient of friction, leading to less grip and increased chances of slipping.**  
4. **Why do metals expand when heated?**  
   **Answer: Metals expand when heated because the particles gain energy and move apart, increasing the material's overall size.**  
5. **Why is repulsion considered a sure test for magnetism?**  
   **Answer: Repulsion is considered a sure test for magnetism because only like poles repel, confirming that an object is a magnet.**

### **SECTION B** (Descriptive & Numerical)  

#### **Q7. Answer all the following questions:** [10]  
1. **Define density and write its formula.**  
   **Answer: Density is defined as the mass per unit volume of a substance.**  
   **Formula: ρ = m/V**  
2. **Explain lateral inversion with an example.**  
   **Answer: Lateral inversion is the phenomenon where the left side of an object appears as the right side in its mirror image. Example: The word "AMBULANCE" is written in reverse on ambulances so that it appears correctly in a rear-view mirror.**  
3. **State the laws of reflection.**  
   **Answer:**  
   - The incident ray, reflected ray, and the normal lie in the same plane.  
   - The angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection.  
4. **What is an electromagnet? List two uses of electromagnets.**  
   **Answer: An electromagnet is a temporary magnet created by passing electric current through a coil of wire around an iron core.**  
   **Uses: Electric bells, MRI machines.**  
5. **Explain the working of a simple electric bell.**  
   **Answer: A simple electric bell works using an electromagnet that attracts a metal arm when current flows, striking the bell and breaking the circuit repeatedly to produce sound.**  
6. **Convert 35°C to Kelvin and Fahrenheit.**  
   **Answer:**  
   - **Kelvin:** K = 35 + 273 = **308 K**  
   - **Fahrenheit:** F = (9/5 × 35) + 32 = **95°F**  
7. **Define potential difference and state its SI unit.**  
   **Answer: Potential difference is the work done per unit charge to move a charge between two points.**  
   **SI unit: Volt (V)**
