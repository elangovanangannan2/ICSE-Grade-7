## **1. Heat and Temperature**

- **Heat** is a form of energy that results from the motion of molecules in an object.
- **Temperature** is the measure of heat energy present in an object.
- Heat always flows from a **hotter object** to a **colder object** until **thermal equilibrium** is reached.

### **Formulas:**

1. **Heat Energy Relation with Temperature**  
   $Q = mc\Delta T$
   where:
   
   - Q  = Heat energy (Joules)
   - m  = Mass of the object (kg)
   - c  = Specific heat capacity ($J/kg°C$)
   - $\Delta T$  = Change in temperature (°C)

2. **Units of Heat Energy:**
   
   - 1 calorie = **4.18 Joules**
   - 1 kilocalorie = **1000 calories**

**Example:**  
Find the heat required to raise the temperature of 2 kg of water from 25°C to 75°C.  
Given  c  for water = **$4.18 J/g°C$** = **$4180 J/kg°C$**  

$Q = (2)(4180)(75 - 25) = 418000 J$

## **2. Temperature Scales and Conversion**

- **Celsius Scale**: 0°C (freezing point of water) to 100°C (boiling point of water)
- **Fahrenheit Scale**: 32°F (freezing) to 212°F (boiling)
- **Kelvin Scale**: 273 K (freezing) to 373 K (boiling)

### **Conversion Formulas:**

1. **Celsius to Fahrenheit:**
   $F = \frac{9}{5}C + 32$

2. **Fahrenheit to Celsius:**
   $C = \frac{5}{9} (F - 32)$

3. **Celsius to Kelvin:**
   K = C + 273

**Example:** Convert 90°F to °C.  

$C = \frac{5}{9} (90 - 32) = 32.2°C$

## **3. Effects of Heat**

1. **Change in Temperature**  
   - Heat causes temperature to rise.
2. **Change in Size (Expansion and Contraction)**
   - **Thermal Expansion**: Increase in length, area, or volume due to heating.
   - **Thermal Contraction**: Decrease in size due to cooling.

### **Types of Expansion:**

- **Linear Expansion:**
  $\Delta L = L_0 \alpha \Delta T$

- **Superficial Expansion:**
  $\Delta A = A_0 \beta \Delta T$

- **Cubical Expansion:**
  $\Delta V = V_0 \gamma \Delta T$
  where:
  
  - $\alpha$ ,  $\beta$ ,  $\gamma$  are expansion coefficients.

**Example:** A 1 m iron rod expands by 0.001 m when heated from 20°C to 120°C. Find  $\alpha$ .  

$\alpha = \frac{\Delta L}{L_0 \Delta T} = \frac{0.001}{1 \times 100} = 10^{-5} / °C$

3. **Change in State**  
   - **Melting (Fusion)**: Solid → Liquid (Absorbs heat)  
   - **Boiling (Vaporization)**: Liquid → Gas (Absorbs heat)  
   - **Condensation**: Gas → Liquid (Releases heat)  
   - **Freezing (Solidification)**: Liquid → Solid (Releases heat)  
   - **Sublimation**: Solid → Gas (Absorbs heat)

## **4. Modes of Heat Transfer**

### **1. Conduction**

- Transfer of heat through direct contact in solids.

- **Formula for Heat Conduction**:
  $Q = \frac{k A (T_1 - T_2) t}{d}$
  where:
  
  - k  = Thermal conductivity
  - A  = Cross-sectional area
  - $T_1, T_2$  = Temperatures
  - d  = Thickness
  - t  = Time

**Example:** A metal rod conducts **1000 J** of heat in **5 seconds**. If its length is **2 m**, area is **0.01 m²**, and temperature difference is **50°C**, find  k .

$k = \frac{Q d}{A (T_1 - T_2) t} = \frac{1000 \times 2}{0.01 \times 50 \times 5} = 80 \text{ W/m°C}$

### **2. Convection**

- Heat transfer in liquids and gases through movement of particles.
- Examples:
  - **Sea breeze and Land breeze**
  - **Hot air rising in a room**

### **3. Radiation**

- Heat transfer without a medium.
- Example:
  - **Sun’s heat reaching Earth.**

**Factors Affecting Radiation:**

- **Black surfaces**: Best absorbers and emitters.
- **White/silvery surfaces**: Best reflectors.

## **5. Applications of Heat Concepts**

1. **Expansion Applications:**
   
   - **Bridges have expansion joints** to avoid cracking.
   - **Gaps in railway tracks** prevent buckling.
   - **Electric wires sag in summer and tighten in winter** due to thermal expansion.

2. **Convection Applications:**
   
   - **Ventilation in houses** to remove hot air.
   - **Refrigerators** keep the freezer on top to allow cold air to sink.
   - **Chimneys in factories** remove hot gases.

3. **Radiation Applications:**
   
   - **Thermos Flask** reduces heat transfer through conduction, convection, and radiation.
   - **Black car seats absorb heat, while white reflects it**.

## **Example Problems**

1. **A 500 g metal block requires 2100 J of heat to raise its temperature by 20°C. Find its specific heat capacity.**  
   $c = \frac{Q}{m \Delta T} = \frac{2100}{0.5 \times 20} = 210 \text{ J/kg°C}$

2. **What is the temperature at which Fahrenheit reading is five times the Celsius reading?**  
   Using  $C = \frac{5}{9} (F - 32)$  and given  F = 5C , solve:
   $C = \frac{5}{9} (5C - 32)$

   9C = 25C - 160

   16C = 160

   C = 10°C, F = 50°F
