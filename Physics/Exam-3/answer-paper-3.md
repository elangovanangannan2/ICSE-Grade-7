### **SECTION B** (Descriptive & Numerical)

#### **Q5. Answer all the following questions:** [10]

1. **Define impulse and derive its relation with momentum.**  
   **Answer:** Impulse is the product of force and time duration. 
   - **Relation with momentum:** Impulse = Change in momentum (Ft = mv - mu)  
2. **Explain how the concept of moment of inertia is related to rotational motion.**  
   **Answer:** Moment of inertia is the rotational equivalent of mass and affects how a body resists angular acceleration.  
3. **Derive an expression for the acceleration due to gravity at a depth  d  inside the Earth.**  
   **Answer:**  $g_d = g (1 - d/R)$ , where R is Earth's radius.  
4. **Why do astronauts appear weightless in a spacecraft?**  
   **Answer:** Astronauts appear weightless because they are in a state of free fall towards Earth, experiencing microgravity.  
5. **Explain how a moving coil galvanometer works.**  
   **Answer:** A moving coil galvanometer works on the principle of electromagnetic induction.  
6. **Convert 100 K to Celsius and Fahrenheit.**  
   **Answer:** 
   - **Celsius:**  $T_C = T_K - 273 = -173°C$   
   - **Fahrenheit:**  $T_F = (9/5     \times (-173)) + 32 = -279.4°F$
