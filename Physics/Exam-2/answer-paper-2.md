### **SECTION B** (Descriptive & Numerical)

#### **Q6. Answer all the following questions:** [10]

1. **Work is defined as the force applied on an object that causes displacement in the direction of the applied force.**  
   - **SI Unit:** Joule (J)  
2. **Atmospheric pressure is the pressure exerted by the air in the atmosphere on all objects.**  
   - **Example:** The collapsing of an empty tin when the air inside is removed.  
3. **The sky appears blue during the day due to Rayleigh scattering.** During sunrise and sunset, the sunlight has to pass through a longer atmospheric path, scattering shorter wavelengths and allowing red and orange hues to be visible.  
4. **Ohm’s law states that the current through a conductor is directly proportional to the voltage across it and inversely proportional to the resistance.**  
   - **Formula:** V = IR  
5. **Concave vs. Convex lenses:** Concave lenses diverge light rays, forming virtual images. Convex lenses converge light rays, forming real or virtual images.  
6. **Temperature conversions:**  
   - **Kelvin:** K = 45 + 273 = **318 K**  
   - **Fahrenheit:** F = (9/5 × 45) + 32 = **113°F**  
7. **Power is the rate at which work is done.**  
   - **Formula:** P = VI

#### **Q7. Distinguish between the following:** [10]

1. **Mass vs. Weight:** Mass is the amount of matter in an object (kg). Weight is the force due to gravity (N).  
2. **Series vs. Parallel circuits:** In a series circuit, current remains the same; in a parallel circuit, voltage remains the same.  
3. **AC vs. DC current:** AC changes direction periodically; DC flows in one direction.  
4. **Renewable vs. Non-renewable energy:** Renewable energy sources are replenishable (e.g., solar). Non-renewable sources deplete over time (e.g., coal).  
5. **Evaporation vs. Boiling:** Evaporation occurs at all temperatures; boiling occurs at a fixed temperature.

#### **Q8. Solve the following numerical problems:** [20]

1. **(a)** Work done = Force × Distance  
   - W = 50 N × 5 m = **250 J**  
     **(b)** Force = Mass × Acceleration  
   - F = 2 kg × 3 m/s² = **6 N**  
2. **(a)** Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity.  
   - Formula: a = (v - u) / t  
     **(b)** Final velocity: v = u + at  
   - v = 10 + (2 × 5) = **20 m/s**  
3. **(a)** Electromagnetic induction occurs when a changing magnetic field induces an electric current in a conductor.  
   **(b)** Ohm’s law: V = IR  
   - I = V / R = 10V / 5Ω = **2 A**  
4. **(a)** Power of a lens: P = 100 / f  
   - P = 100 / 20 = **5 D**  
     **(b)** Energy conversion:  
   - 100 J = 100 / 4.18 = **23.92 cal**
