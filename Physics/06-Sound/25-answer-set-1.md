### **SECTION B** (Descriptive & Numerical)

#### **Q6. Answer all the following questions:** [10]

1. **Define sound and explain how it is produced.**  
   **Answer:** Sound is a form of energy that travels through a medium as a longitudinal wave. It is produced when an object vibrates, creating compressions and rarefactions in the medium.  
2. **What are the differences between transverse waves and longitudinal waves?**  
   **Answer:**  
   - Transverse waves: Particles move perpendicular to wave direction (e.g., light waves).  
   - Longitudinal waves: Particles move parallel to wave direction (e.g., sound waves).  
3. **Explain the factors affecting the speed of sound in different media.**  
   **Answer:** The speed of sound depends on the medium’s density, elasticity, and temperature. It is highest in solids, lower in liquids, and lowest in gases.  
4. **Describe the working of the human ear in hearing sound.**  
   **Answer:** The ear detects sound waves, which are funneled by the outer ear to the eardrum. Vibrations are transmitted through the middle ear bones and converted into nerve signals in the cochlea.  
5. **Explain the phenomenon of an echo and its applications.**  
   **Answer:** An echo occurs when sound reflects off a surface and returns to the listener. Applications include SONAR and measuring distances.  
6. **Convert 50 dB into the logarithmic scale of sound intensity.**  
   **Answer:**  I = $10^{(50/10)}$  =  $10^5$  times the reference intensity.  
7. **Discuss the applications of ultrasound in medicine and industry.**  
   **Answer:** Ultrasound is used in medical imaging (e.g., sonography) and industrial applications like detecting cracks in metals.

#### **Q7. Distinguish between the following:** [10]

1. **Loudness vs. Pitch:** Loudness depends on amplitude; pitch depends on frequency.  
2. **Echo vs. Reverberation:** Echo is distinct reflection; reverberation is multiple reflections.  
3. **Sound waves in solids vs. gases:** Faster in solids due to tightly packed molecules.  
4. **Infrasonic vs. Ultrasonic sounds:** Infrasonic <20 Hz, Ultrasonic >20 kHz.  
5. **Noise vs. Musical sound:** Noise is irregular; music has harmony and pattern.

#### **Q8. Solve the following numerical problems:** [20]

1. **(a) Frequency = Speed / Wavelength = 340 / 2 = 170 Hz**  
   **(b) Time period = 1 / Frequency = 1 / 500 = 0.002 s**  
2. **(a) Distance = (Speed × Time) / 2 = (343 × 3) / 2 = 514.5 m**  
   **(b) Wavelength = Speed / Frequency = 340 / 256 = 1.33 m**  
3. **(a) SONAR uses reflected ultrasound waves to determine depth.**  
   **(b) Depth = (Speed × Time) / 2 = (1500 × 4) / 2 = 3000 m**  
4. **(a) Speed = Wavelength × Frequency = $1.5 × 400 = 600 m/s$**  
   **(b)  $dB = 10 \log(10^{-6} / 10^{-12}) = 60 dB$ **
