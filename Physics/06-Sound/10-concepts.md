# **Lesson: Sound - Summary with Formulas & Examples**

## **1. Introduction to Sound**

- Sound is a form of energy that is produced by vibrating objects and propagates as a wave through a medium.
- It requires a medium (solid, liquid, or gas) to travel and cannot propagate in a vacuum.

---

## **2. Wave Nature of Sound**

- Sound waves are **longitudinal waves**, where particles of the medium vibrate **parallel** to the direction of wave propagation.
- Sound waves consist of **compressions** (regions of high pressure) and **rarefactions** (regions of low pressure).

### **Formula for Wave Speed**

$v = f \lambda$

where:

- v  = speed of sound (m/s),
- f  = frequency of the wave (Hz),
- $\lambda  = wavelength (m)$

**Example:**  
If a sound wave has a frequency of 500 Hz and a wavelength of 0.68 m, then its speed is:

$v = 500 \times 0.68 = 340 \text{ m/s}$

---

## **3. Speed of Sound in Different Media**

- The speed of sound depends on the medium and increases from gases to liquids to solids.

| Medium        | Speed of Sound (m/s) |
| ------------- | -------------------- |
| Air (at 20°C) | 343                  |
| Water         | 1484                 |
| Steel         | 5000                 |

- Speed of sound in a gas is given by:

$v = \sqrt{\frac{\gamma R T}{M}}$

where:

- $\gamma$  = adiabatic index,
- R  = universal gas constant,
- T  = temperature in Kelvin,
- M  = molar mass of gas.

**Example:**  
For air at 300 K, using  $\gamma = 1.4$ ,  R = 8.314 , and  M = 0.029  kg/mol:

$v = \sqrt{\frac{1.4 \times 8.314 \times 300}{0.029}} = 347 \text{ m/s}$

---

## **4. Reflection of Sound (Echo & Reverberation)**

- **Echo:** The reflection of sound when it bounces off a surface and is heard again.
- **Reverberation:** Prolonged persistence of sound due to multiple reflections.

### **Formula for Echo**

$d = \frac{v \times t}{2}$

where:

- d  = minimum distance of reflecting surface (m),
- v  = speed of sound (m/s),
- t  = minimum time interval (s).

**Example:**  
For an echo to be heard distinctly, the minimum time gap is **0.1 seconds**. If the speed of sound is 340 m/s:

$d = \frac{340 \times 0.1}{2} = 17 \text{ m}$

So, the reflecting surface must be at least **17 m** away.

---

## **5. Loudness and Intensity of Sound**

- **Loudness** is a subjective measure and depends on the amplitude of the sound wave.
- **Intensity** is the sound energy per unit area per unit time.

### **Formula for Intensity**

$I = \frac{P}{A}$

where:

- I  = intensity (W/m²),
- P  = power (W),
- A  = area (m²).

**Example:**  
If a speaker emits **20 W** of sound energy uniformly in all directions, and we measure at **10 m** from the source:

$I = \frac{20}{4\pi (10)^2} = \frac{20}{1256.64} = 0.0159 \text{ W/m²}$

---

## **6. Frequency and Pitch**

- **Frequency (Hz):** The number of vibrations per second.
- **Pitch:** How high or low a sound is, determined by frequency.

### **Formula for Frequency of Vibrating String**

$f = \frac{1}{2L} \sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}}$

where:

- f  = frequency (Hz),
- L  = length of vibrating string (m),
- T  = tension in the string (N),
- $\mu$  = linear mass density (kg/m).

**Example:**  
For a string of length **0.5 m**, mass per unit length **0.01 kg/m**, and tension **100 N**:

$f = \frac{1}{2 \times 0.5} \sqrt{\frac{100}{0.01}} = 5 \times 100 = 500 \text{ Hz}$

---

## **7. Doppler Effect (Change in Frequency due to Motion)**

- **Doppler Effect**: Change in frequency due to the relative motion between source and observer.

### **Formula for Doppler Effect**

$f' = f \left( \frac{v \pm v_o}{v \mp v_s} \right)$

where:

- $f'$  = apparent frequency,
- f  = actual frequency,
- v  = speed of sound,
- $v_o$  = velocity of observer,
- $v_s$  = velocity of source.

**Example:**  
A police siren at **500 Hz** moves towards a stationary observer at **30 m/s** while sound speed is **340 m/s**:

$f' = 500 \left( \frac{340}{340 - 30} \right) = 500 \times 1.088 = 544 \text{ Hz}$

The observer hears a higher frequency.

---

## **8. Resonance in Sound**

- **Resonance**: When an object vibrates at its natural frequency due to another vibrating object of the same frequency.

### **Formula for Open and Closed Pipes**

- **Open Pipe:**

$f_n = \frac{n v}{2L}$

- **Closed Pipe:**

$f_n = \frac{(2n - 1)v}{4L}$

where:

- n  = harmonic number,
- L  = length of pipe.

**Example:**  
For an open pipe of **0.5 m** and speed of sound **340 m/s**:

$f_1 = \frac{1 \times 340}{2 \times 0.5} = 340 \text{ Hz}$

---
