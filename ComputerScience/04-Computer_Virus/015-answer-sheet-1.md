4. **Examples of Trojan Horse viruses include Zeus Trojan and Emotet.**  
5. **Symptoms of a virus attack include slow computer performance, frequent crashes, and unauthorized pop-ups.**  
6. **Spyware secretly gathers information about a user’s activities and sends it to a hacker, often leading to privacy breaches.**  
7. **Email attachments may contain hidden malware or scripts that execute harmful activities upon opening.**  
8. **Two methods to prevent virus attacks are installing antivirus software and avoiding suspicious downloads.**  
9. **Antivirus software scans, detects, and removes malicious programs from a computer system.**  
10. **Ransomware encrypts files on a computer and demands payment for unlocking them.**

#### Q4. GIVE TWO DIFFERENCES BETWEEN:  
a) **Virus and Worm**: A Virus requires a host file, while a Worm spreads independently.  
b) **Trojan Horse and Spyware**: A Trojan Horse disguises itself as legitimate software, while Spyware secretly collects data.  
c) **Antivirus and Firewall**: Antivirus detects and removes malware, while a Firewall blocks unauthorized network access.  
d) **Boot Sector Virus and Multipartite Virus**: A Boot Sector Virus only affects the boot sector, whereas a Multipartite Virus affects both boot sector and files.  
e) **Adware and Ransomware**: Adware displays unwanted ads, while Ransomware locks files and demands payment.
